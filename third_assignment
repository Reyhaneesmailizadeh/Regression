Assignment 3:

Data in Table 3.3 pertains to a study on driving accidents and vehicle safety. The variables: vehicle speed and braking distance to complete stop are displayed.

a. Plot a scatter plot (1). Do you think a linear regression model is suitable for the data?
b. Fit a simple linear regression model to the data and calculate residuals. Calculate standardized residuals.
c. Plot standardized residuals against fitted values and comment on them.
d. Use the 2 - 1 transformation, derive the linear regression model 11 vs. and plot the standardized residuals of this model.
e. Obtain the determination coefficient values for the models in parts "b" and "d" and comment on the obtained results.
Data from Table 4.3 by Carroll and Spiegelman (1986) investigates the relationship between pressure in a source and fluid volume inside the source.

a. Fit a linear regression model to this data and obtain residuals.
b. Plot QQ plot of residuals and describe.
c. Plot standardized residuals against fitted values and interpret.
d. Assume the data collection is in chronological order as presented in the above table. Plot residuals against time and interpret.
e. Conduct a lack-of-fit test for the linear regression model for data in Table 4.3.
