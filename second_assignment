a. Fit a second-degree polynomial regression line.
b. Estimate the error term variance of the model and calculate the variance estimates of the linear regression model parameters using it.
c. Perform a significant test for the linear regression model in two different methods.
d. Construct an analysis of variance table to determine whether the linear regression model is significant or not.
e. For a specific value of 0.580 = , obtain the confidence interval and prediction interval for the predictor variable.
