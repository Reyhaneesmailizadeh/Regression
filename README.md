  <h2>Simple Linear Regression</h2>

  <p>
    Explore the relationship between goals conceded and games won by soccer teams. Analyze the correlation between weight and blood pressure.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fit a simple linear regression model between goals conceded and games won.</li>
    <li>Calculate residuals and estimate the error variance.</li>
    <li>Estimate the correlation coefficient between weight and blood pressure.</li>
    <li>Fit a simple linear regression model to predict blood pressure based on weight.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Multiple Linear Regression</h2>

  <p>
    Analyze the relationship between terylene adhesion, disease severity, and pine tree characteristics.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fit a simple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between molar ratio of acid and terylene adhesion.</li>
    <li>Fit a multiple linear regression model to predict terylene adhesion based on molar ratio of acid and weight.</li>
    <li>Fit a simple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between disease severity and patient body temperature.</li>
    <li>Fit a multiple linear regression model to predict disease severity based on patient body temperature and other relevant factors.</li>
    <li>Fit a second-degree polynomial regression line to relate specific modulus and specific weight of pine trees.</li>
  </ul>
